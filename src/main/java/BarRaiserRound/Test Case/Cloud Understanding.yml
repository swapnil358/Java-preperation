  ### Cloud Fundamentals:

  1. What is cloud computing, and how does it differ from traditional computing?:
            :** Cloud computing is a technology that provides on-demand access to computing resources over the internet.
                   It differs from traditional computing by allowing users to access and use resources (e.g., servers, storage, databases)
                   without the need for physical infrastructure.

  2. Explain the three essential service models in cloud computing: IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS.**
        - *IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service):* Offers virtualized computing resources over the internet.
              Real-time Example: Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) on AWS
              Amazon EC2 is a prime example of IaaS. It provides virtual servers in the cloud, allowing users to run applications,
              manage workloads, and store data without investing in physical hardware.
              Use Case: Suppose a company wants to host its web application.
              Instead of purchasing and maintaining physical servers, they can use Amazon EC2 instances.
              They have full control over the virtual machines, including the operating system, and can scale resources up or down based on demand.


       - *PaaS (Platform as a Service):* Provides a platform for application development and deployment without managing the
                underlying infrastructure.
             Real-time Example: Heroku
               Heroku is a PaaS provider that simplifies application deployment and management.
               Developers can focus on writing code without dealing with the underlying infrastructure.
             Use Case: A development team working on a web application can use Heroku to deploy and host their application.
              Heroku handles the platform, runtime, and infrastructure aspects, allowing developers to concentrate on building and improving their application.

        - *SaaS (Software as a Service):* Delivers software applications over the internet without the need for local installations.
              Software as a Service (SaaS):
              Real-time Example: Google Workspace (formerly G Suite)
                Google Workspace is a SaaS offering that provides a suite of productivity and collaboration tools,
                including Gmail, Google Drive, Google Docs, and more.
              Use Case: A company can use Google Workspace for email, document collaboration,
                and communication. Users access these services through a web browser without the need for installing or maintaining software locally.
