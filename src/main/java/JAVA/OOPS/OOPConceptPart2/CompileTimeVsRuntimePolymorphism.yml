Method Overloading (Compile-Time Polymorphism):

  Definition: Method overloading allows a class to have multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists (different number or types of parameters).

  Compile-Time Polymorphism: The decision of which method to call is made by the compiler at compile time based on the method signature.





  Method Overriding (Runtime Polymorphism):
Definition: Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation
  for a method that is already defined in its superclass.

Runtime Polymorphism: The decision of which method to call is made at runtime based on the actual type of the object.
