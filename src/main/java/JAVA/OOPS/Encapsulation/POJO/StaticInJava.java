    /*Static Fields (Class Variables):

    Static fields are shared among all instances of a class.
    They are declared using the static keyword.
    They are accessed using the class name, not through instances of the class.
    Example:



    Static Methods:

    Similar to static fields, static methods belong to the class rather than an instance.
    They are declared using the static keyword.
    They can be called using the class name, not requiring an instance of the class.
    Example:


    Static Block:

    A static block is a block of code enclosed in curly braces {} and preceded by the static keyword.
    It is executed when the class is loaded into the memory.
    It is often used for static initialization.


    Static Nested Classes:

    A static nested class is a nested class that is declared with the static keyword.
    It can be accessed using the enclosing class name.



    It's important to note that:

    Static members are associated with the class itself, not with instances of the class.
    They are typically used for utility methods, constants, or variables that should be shared across all instances of a class.
    Static members can be accessed even before any instances of the class are created.
    Static methods cannot directly access instance variables or call non-static methods unless they operate on an instance of the class.
