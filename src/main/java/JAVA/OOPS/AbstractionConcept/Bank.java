//Abstract class vs Interface -->  https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-abstract-class-and-interface-in-java/

/*@Main difference is methods of a Java interface are implicitly abstract and cannot have implementations. 
 * 
 * A Java abstract class can have instance methods that implements a default behavior.
 * Variables declared in a Java interface is by default final. 
 * An  abstract class may contain non-final variables.
 * Members of a Java interface are public by default. 
 * A Java abstract class can have the usual flavors of class members like private, protected, etc..
 * Java interface should be implemented using keyword 'implements'
 * A Java abstract class should be extended using keyword �extends�.
 * An interface can extend another Java interface only, 
 * an abstract class can extend another Java class and implement multiple Java interfaces.
 * A Java class can implement multiple interfaces but it can extend only one abstract class.
 * Interface is absolutely abstract and cannot be instantiated; 
 * A Java abstract class also cannot be instantiated, but can be invoked if a main() method exists.
In comparison with java abstract classes, java interfaces are slow as it requires extra indirection.

	// Partial abstraction. - Loan() is abstract in nature, but credit and debit is
	// common in all child classes
	// Hiding the Implementation logic --is called Abstraction.
	// abstract class can have abstract method as well as Non-abstract method
	// Can not create the Object of Abstract class  ---
	//			because--> you cannot create an object of an abstract class in Java.
	//			An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated directly
	//			because it may contain abstract methods that have no implementation in the abstract class itself.
	//			Abstract classes are meant to be subclassed, and objects should be created from the concrete subclasses.
	// Can not create the Object of Interface class

	 * unauthorized methods.
