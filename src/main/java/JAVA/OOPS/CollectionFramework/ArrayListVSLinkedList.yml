  /**
    * Underlying Data Structure:
    /*=========================
    * ArrayList: Uses a dynamic array to store elements. It provides random access to elements based on index.
    * LinkedList: Uses a doubly-linked list to store elements. It provides sequential access to elements.

    * Insertion and Deletion:
    /*=========================
    * ArrayList: Insertion and deletion operations can be slower, 
                 especially when elements need to be added or removed from the middle of the list, 
                 as it may require shifting elements.
    * LinkedList: Insertion and deletion operations are generally faster, 
                 especially when manipulating elements in the middle of the list, as it involves updating pointers.


    * Access Time:
    /*===============
    * ArrayList: Provides fast random access to elements using index. Retrieving an element at a specific index is efficient.
    * LinkedList: Sequential access is faster. Random access involves traversing the list from the beginning or end, 
                  which can be slower compared to an ArrayList.
    *
    *
    * Memory Overhead:
    /*===================
    * ArrayList: Has less memory overhead per element since it only needs to store the elements and an array to hold them.
    * LinkedList: Requires additional memory for storing pointers (references) to the next and previous elements, 
                  resulting in higher memory overhead per element.
    *
    *
    * Iterating through Elements:
    /*==============================
    * ArrayList: Iterating through elements using an enhanced for loop or an iterator is generally faster.
    * LinkedList: Iterating through elements involves following pointers sequentially, which can be slower compared to an ArrayList.


    * In summary, if you frequently need fast random access to elements and the list size doesn't often change, 
    ArrayList might be more suitable. If you frequently insert or remove elements, especially in the middle of the list, 
    and sequential access is more common, LinkedList might be a better choice. 
    The best choice depends on the specific requirements and usage patterns of your application.
