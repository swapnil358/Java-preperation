Interview Questions - Round 3 - Top Fintech in MAANG

One of the most challenging interview experience till now for me! 

↳ Hiring Position: SDET IV (SDET Lead)

↳ Coding Problems: 

#1 Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].
The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]

Difficulty Level: Medium as per LeetCode

#2 Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

Difficulty Level: Easy as per LeetCode
