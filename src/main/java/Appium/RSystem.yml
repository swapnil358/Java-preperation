    What is Appium?:
    Appium is an open-source automation tool for mobile applications on iOS and Android platforms.
    It supports native, hybrid, and mobile web applications.

    How does Appium work internally?:
    Appium uses Selenium WebDriver to interact with mobile applications.
    It communicates with the mobile device or emulator using the w3c protocol and
    translates the Selenium commands into mobile-specific automation actions.

    Explain the difference between Native, Hybrid, and Mobile Web Applications.:
    Native: Built for a specific platform using platform-specific programming languages.
    Hybrid: Combines web and native elements, often using web views embedded in native applications.
    Mobile Web: Mobile-optimized websites accessed through a mobile browser.


  Appium Setup:
    How do you set up Appium on your machine?:
    Appium can be set up using npm (Node Package Manager). Install Node.js, Appium, and the necessary dependencies.

    Explain Desired Capabilities in Appium.:
    Desired Capabilities are a set of key-value pairs used to configure the Appium server. They include information
    about the device, platform, app, and automation settings.

    Appium server default port:
      0.0.0.0:4723

Start Appium server programatically:

  AppiumDriverLocalService service = AppiumDriverLocalService.buildDefaultService();

  service.start(); //start the appium server

  System.out.println(service.isRunning());
  System.out.println(service.getUrl());

Start Appium server with custome App:
  AppiumServiceBuilder builder=new AppiumServiceBuilder()
  .usingAnyFreePort()
  .withArgument(GeneralServerFlag.RELAXED_SECURITY)
  .withArgument(GeneralServerFlag.SESSION_OVERRIDE)
  .withLogFile(new File("appium.log"));

  AppiumDriverLocalService service = AppiumDriverLocalService.buildService(builder);

  service.start(); //start the appium server

  System.out.println(service.isRunning());
  System.out.println(service.getUrl());

  Automation Scripting:
    How do you find an element on a mobile app using Appium?:
    Use methods like findElementById(), findElementByClassName(), findElementByXPath(), etc., to locate elements.

    Explain the difference between findElement() and findElements() in Appium.:
    findElement() returns the first matching element, while findElements() returns a list of all matching elements.

    How do you perform a long press on an element using Appium?:
    Use the longPress() method.

    Example:
    TouchAction().longPress(element).release().perform().


    How can you swipe on a mobile screen in Appium?:
    Use TouchAction class to perform a swipe action. Example:
    TouchAction().press(x, y).moveTo(x, y).release().perform().


    Explain the concept of Contexts in Appium.:
     Contexts represent the different environments or components in a mobile application, such as native, web, or hybrid. Use contextHandles() to get the available contexts and switch between them.

   Handling Mobile Gestures:
   How do you handle multiple fingers gestures (e.g., pinch and zoom) in Appium?
    Use the multiTouch() method in the TouchAction class to perform multiple touch gestures simultaneously.

    Explain the steps to automate scrolling in a mobile app using Appium.:
    Use a combination of scrollTo(), scrollToExact(), or swipe actions to scroll through the app.

   Handling Alerts and Pop-ups:

  How do you handle alerts in Appium?:
   Use the switchTo().alert() method to switch to the alert, and then use accept(), dismiss(), or getText() as needed.

    Explain how to handle a confirmation pop-up in Appium.:
  Use the switchTo().alert() method to switch to the alert, and then use accept(), dismiss(), or getText() as needed.



  Page Object Model (POM):
    What is the Page Object Model (POM) in Appium?

  Answer: POM is a design pattern where each page in the mobile app is represented as a class, and the actions and elements on that page are encapsulated within that class.
    Explain the advantages of using the Page Object Model in Appium.

  Answer:
    Code reusability.
    Improved maintainability.
    Enhanced readability.
    Easy to maintain and update.

  Answer: Specify the device's UDID in the desired capabilities and connect the device to the machine.

    Explain the differences between testing on a real device and an emulator in Appium.:
  Answer: Emulators are software-based, while real devices are physical devices. Testing on real devices provides more accurate results but may be slower than testing on emulators.

  Handling Hybrid Apps:
    How do you automate interactions with a WebView in a hybrid mobile app using Appium?:
  Answer: Switch to the WebView context using contextHandles() and perform actions using standard Selenium WebDriver commands.

  Appium Server:
    What is the Appium server and why is it needed?:
  Answer: The Appium server is responsible for managing the communication between the client (test script) and the mobile device. It translates the Selenium commands into mobile automation actions.


    How do you start the Appium server programmatically using Appium Java client?:
  Answer: Use the AppiumDriverLocalService class to programmatically start and stop the Appium server.

  AppiumDriverLocalService service = AppiumDriverLocalService.buildService(builder);

  service.start(); //start the appium server

  System.out.println(service.isRunning());
  System.out.println(service.getUrl());

  Handling Synchronization:
    How do you handle synchronization issues in Appium?:
  Answer: Use implicit and explicit waits (WebDriverWait) to wait for elements to be present, visible, or clickable before performing actions.
    Explain the difference between implicit wait and explicit wait in Appium.

  Answer:
  Implicit Wait: Set once and applies to all elements. It waits for a specified amount of time before throwing a NoSuchElementException.
  Explicit Wait: Applied to a specific element. It waits for a certain condition to occur before proceeding.

  Handling Network Conditions:
    How do you simulate different network conditions (e.g., 3G, 4G) in Appium?:
  Answer: Use the driver.setNetworkConnection() method in the AppiumDriver class to simulate different network conditions.
  // Simulate 3G network:
  driver.setNetworkConnection(1); // 1 represents 3G

  // Simulate 4G network:
  driver.setNetworkConnection(6); // 6 represents 4G
